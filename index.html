			<!-- the text is put on multiple lines to make it more readable -->
			The term meme, is a relatively new word, having been coined in the late 90's and is older than the world-wide web itself. 
			The term was originally coined from the Greek word mimeme, meme for short. Dawkins was an evolutionary biologist and the 
			term was originally meant for the concept that ideas evolve and change like genes and organisms themselves, and hence the
			term meme was born.
